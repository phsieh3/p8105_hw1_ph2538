The purpose of this file is to complete Homework 1

# Problem 1

First we create a dataframe containing variables of four different types.
A random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution
A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
A (length-10) character vector
A (length-10) factor vector


```{r example_df}

set.seed(10)

example_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10, 0:5),
  vec_logical = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE),
  vec_char = c("This", "Is", "A", "Character", "Vector", "For", "Homework", "One", "Data", "Science"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male"))
)
```
