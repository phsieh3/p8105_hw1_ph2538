# Problem 1

First we create a dataframe containing variables of four different
types. A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution A
logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
than 2 A (length-10) character vector A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
set.seed(1234)
samp = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)

example_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = samp,
  vec_logical = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE),
  vec_char = c("This", "Is", "A", "Character", "Vector", "For", "Homework", "One", "Data", "Science"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male"))
)
```

samp = rnorm(10, 1:5)
