# Problem 1

-----

## Create a dataframe containing variables of four different types.

  - A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution

  - A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 2

  - A (length-10) character vector

  - A (length-10) factor vector

<!-- end list -->

``` r
set.seed(1234)
samp = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)

example_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = samp,
  vec_logical = samp > 2,
  vec_char = c("This", "Is", "A", "Character", "Vector", "For", "Homework", "One", "Data", "Science"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male"))
)
```

## Take the mean of each variable in dataframe.

``` r
mean(example_df$vec_numeric)
```

    ## [1] 2.446132

``` r
mean(example_df$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(example_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(example_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(example_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(example_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Taking the mean only works for numeric and logical vectors, not
character and factor vectors. Character and factor vectors cannot be
recognized as numbers.

## Use as.numeric on logical, character, and factor variables.

``` r
as.numeric(example_df$vec_logical)
as.numeric(example_df$vec_char)
as.numeric(example_df$vec_factor)
```

For logical variables, it changes the T/F into 1’s and 0’s. For
character variables, it becomes NA. For factor variables, it becomes 1’s
and 2’s.

# Problem 2

-----

## Create a dataframe of:

  - x: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution

  - y: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution

  - A logical vector indicating whether the x + y \> 0

  - A numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector

  - A factor vector created by coercing the above logical vector

<!-- end list -->

``` r
set.seed(4321)
x_1000 = rnorm(1000)
y_1000 = rnorm(1000)

df_normal = tibble(
  x = x_1000,
  y = y_1000,
  logical_xy = x + y > 0,
  numeric_xy = as.numeric(logical_xy),
  factor_xy = as.factor(logical_xy)
)
```

-----

  - The size of dataset is 1000, 5.
  - The mean of x is -0.0026747.
  - The median of x is 0.0136634.
  - The proportion of cases for which logical vector is TRUE is 0.509.
