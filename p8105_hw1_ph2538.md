# Problem 1

First we create a dataframe containing variables of four different
types. A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution A
logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
than 2 A (length-10) character vector A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
set.seed(1234)
samp = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)

example_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = samp,
  vec_logical = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE),
  vec_char = c("This", "Is", "A", "Character", "Vector", "For", "Homework", "One", "Data", "Science"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male"))
)
```

Taking the mean of each variable in dataframe. Taking the mean only
works for numeric and logical vectors, not character and factor vectors.
Character and factor vectors cannot be recognized as
    numbers.

``` r
mean(example_df$vec_numeric)
```

    ## [1] 2.446132

``` r
mean(example_df$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(example_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(example_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(example_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(example_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Use as.numeric on logical, character, and factor variables. For logical
variables, it changes the T/F into 1’s and 0’s. For character variables,
it becomes NA. For factor variables, it becomes 1’s and 2’s.

``` r
as.numeric(example_df$vec_logical)
as.numeric(example_df$vec_char)
as.numeric(example_df$vec_factor)
```
